LEGAL NOTICE!!!!!
Be for we go any further.... I am not in anyway responsible if you use this script.
I wrote this to install everything in a few minutes on my own system.
Although its tested a lot, i can not guarantee that it will work on your system.
This is due to me testing it on a clean, fresh out of the box system.
I cannot test if you have other software installed that might interfere with this script.

How to use this script......

1.  place the file in your home folder.
2.  open a terminal
3a. type sudo ./LM_CQRlog_Installer
3b. type sudo ./LM_CQRlog_Installer_incl_HAMlib
4.  After the script is finished REBOOT YOUR COMPUTER!!! if not, this wil not work. 
    DO not try to start CQRlog, this will mess stuff up!!


The scripts are tested on:
- LM19.2
-
